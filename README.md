# Universal-Switching-Power-Supply-96W

This is a schema of chinese switching power supply/charger/adapter.
Probably it will be usefull for someone, who will try to repair the broken piece (like me).

Created by me in Kicad using "reverse engineering".
Parts marked by asterisk are placed on soldering side. No warranty.

I added also photos to identify the model and see how it is constructed.
